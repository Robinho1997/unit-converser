In this project I create an Application which is able to convert units from the metric to the imperial system and vice versa.
The user can type any number in the input field and after clicking the conver button three separate divs are created which show what the input number is in 
- feet/meters
- liters/gallons &
- kilos/pounds

Its quite cool to see that creating such a neat lil project like this is possible with not so much code after all.
Using template strings and puting variables in them did the job good for me!


Here is the url for the finished web application:
